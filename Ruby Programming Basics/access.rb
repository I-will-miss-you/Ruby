=begin 
    Attributes of a class are always protected; we candesignate
    them to have accessors with attr_read, attr_write and attr_accessor
    (or write getters and setters explicitly)

    Methods can be public, private, or protected.
    Public methhods can be used anywehe a class instance is visible.
    Protected methods can only be used within a class or subclass
    Private methods cannote be sent to an explicit receiver.

    The default method access is public

    def initialize(a)
        @a = a
    end

    #this method is public
    def putsA() puts @a end
    
    protected
    def getA() @a end

    private
    def reverseA() @a.reverse end

    def initialize(a)
        super(a)

        puts getA     #OK, getA is protected
        puts reverseA #OK, reverseA is private but there is no explicit receiver
